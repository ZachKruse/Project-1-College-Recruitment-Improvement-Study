perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes.

## Key Research Questions
- What are the most common degree programs among students in the survey?
- How interested are students in taking more computing courses?
- What factors influence studentsâ€™ decisions to enroll at CCM?
- How do race/ethnicity demographics differ between computing and non-computing majors?

The CCM IT Department can improve outreach, course offerings, and student engagement strategies by answering these questions.
